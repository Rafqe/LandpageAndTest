    Color Vision Test (Color Blindness)
            Implement the Ishihara test plates
            Test for different types of color vision deficiencies (protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia)
            Show numbers or patterns in colored dots
            Provide detailed results about color vision capabilities
    Visual Field Test (Peripheral Vision)
            Test peripheral vision by showing dots or shapes in different areas of the screen
            Map the visual field to detect any blind spots or areas of reduced sensitivity
            Create a visual field map showing the results
            Important for detecting conditions like glaucoma
    Depth Perception Test
            Implement a stereopsis test using 3D images
            Test ability to perceive depth and 3D space
            Use random dot stereograms or 3D shapes
            Important for activities like driving and sports
    Eye Movement Test
            Test smooth pursuit eye movements
            Test saccadic eye movements
            Test convergence/divergence
            Important for reading and tracking moving objects
    Night Vision Test
            Test vision in low-light conditions
            Measure dark adaptation
            Important for driving at night
    Glare Sensitivity Test
            Test how well the eyes handle bright lights
            Important for driving and outdoor activities
            Measure recovery time from glare

            Test ability to switch focus between near and far objects
            Important for reading and computer work
            Measure accommodation ability
    Eye Coordination Test
            Test how well both eyes work together
            Important for depth perception and 3D vision
            Test for strabismus (crossed eyes)
